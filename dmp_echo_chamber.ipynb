    "# Dynamic Message Passing and the \"Echo Chamber\" Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling of epidemic spreading has many practical applications - from disease epidemiology to the spread of online rumors. Traditional approaches like the classical SIR model assume a \"fully mixed\" population where interaction between any two individuals is equally likely. These models are popular because they admit simple equations that provide a good general guide to population-level spread dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, contacts between individuals generally differ a lot - some pairs interact more than others. Network epidemiology builds on the traditional approaches by assuming individuals interact on a network that reflects more realistic mixing patterns. But there is a cost - relaxing the fully mixed assumption substantially increases model complexity. For example, computing the infection probabilities of each node over time requires keeping track of the entire joint distribution of nodes. With $n$ individuals that can each be in one of $k$ states, the resuling system of $k^n$ variables quickly becomes computationally intractable, even on moderately sized networks. This means that we generally have to resort to expensive Monte Carlo simulations. A lot of attention has therefore focused on developing analytical approximations that can be computed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But naive approximation methods based on straightforward SIR-type equations suffer from the \"Echo Chamber\" effect, where pairs of adjacent nodes amplify each other's infection probability. This post begins by explaining why intuitive approaches result in this overestimation of infection risk, then implements one of the most popular analytical approaches to overcome this issue - Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) - originally developed in this context by [Karrer and Newman (2010)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5673) with a lot of subsequent work by others ([Lokhov et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5315); [Shrestha et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02192); [Koher et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05809)). We'll focus on a simple discrete time [SI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#Variations_on_the_basic_SIR_model) on a static network in which infected nodes transmit disease to susceptible neighbors with probability $\\beta$ each period, and compare estimates of the infection probabilities for each node $i$, $I_i(t)$, across three approaches - Monte Carlo simulation, a naive analytical approach, and DMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating a simple two-node network to help motivate our intuition. The directed network is represented as a simple two column dataframe with the first and second columns giving the `source` and `target` nodes, respectively, of each directed edge (see a [previous blog post](https://hautahi.com/ic_comparison) comparing four different ways of representing networks in Python)."

    "The following function computes the infection probabilities at time `t` for all nodes via Monte Carlo simulation. In each of `mc` iterations we first draw the initially infected nodes according to their initial infection probabilities stored in the two-column `I0` dataframe. We then simulate the spread dynamics for `t` time periods by first drawing each edge with probability `beta` and then infecting `target` nodes if the `source` node of the remaining edges are infected. The `infected` dictionary at the end of a single MC simulation indicates whether or not a given node is infected. These are then added to a running count across all MC simulations in the `total_infected_count` dictionary, which, after dividing by `mc`, represent the infection probability of each node. The function returns these estimates as a two column dataframe."

In this extremely simple case we can confirm these values to be true. Given the disease only arises in the system with probability 0.4, which can only happen at node 0, we know trivially that $I_0(4)$ must be $0.4$. And if node 0 is initially infected, then it has four chances to infect node 1, and therefore does not infect node 1 with probability $(1-0.2)^4$. This implies that node 1 is infected with probability $1-[0.6+0.4\\times(1-0.2)^4]=0.24$."

    "\n",
    "The above Monte Carlo approach can be very slow for large networks, so we'd prefer to compute the infection probabilities analytically if possible. The most intuitive way to do this is to directly model the evolution of each node in a similar fashion to the classical (fully mixed) version of the SI model. The following expressions for the the probability of being susceptible, $S_i(t)$, and the probability of infected, $I_i(t)$, of node $i$ at time $t$ should look familiar to those experienced with traditional SI models.\n",

    "The probablity of $i$ being susceptible in one period is equal to the probability of it being susceptible in the previous period multiplied by the probability that it was not infected by any of its in-neighbors, denoted by the set $N_i$, in that period. Similar logic holds for the infection probability of $i$, which is equal to the infection probability in the previous period plus the probability of becoming newly infected. Given that $S_i(t) = 1 - I_i(t)$ in our simple SI setup, we actually only need one of the above equations. We'll use the latter in the function below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SI_naive()` function does the same job as `SI_mc()` but using the analytical equations above. After extracting the node id's and the initial infection probabilities from `I0` it iterates over the `t` time periods (note there is no `mc` loop). The `I` dictionary storing the infection probabilities at each period is updated using the equation for $I_i(t+1)$ above, after which a dataframe of estimates is returned in the same format."

    "## The Echo Chamber Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach allows infection to pass back-and-forth between the two nodes, so that once node 1 \"receives\" some infection probability, it passes it back to node 0, which further amplifies the infection probability of node 0, and so on in a self-enforcing \"echo chamber\". But we know this must be wrong because infection can only arise in the system at node 0, so any infection received from its neighbors must have originated with it. To be more formal, in our simple two-node example the equations above reduce to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    I_0(t+1) - I_0(t) &= \\beta S_0(t)I_1(t)\\\\\n",
    "    I_1(t+1) - I_1(t) &= \\beta S_1(t)I_0(t)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which imply that the infection probability will continue to grow until $I_i(t) = 1$ for at least one node. In other words, the equations guarantee that the nodes will eventually becomes infectious, even though with probability $0.6$ there is no infection in the system at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon surprised me a lot when I first encountered it, because the equations seem so intuitive and in line with how we model traditional SI models. So what is wrong with them? The key (but subtle) issue is that they do not account for correlations between the states of adjacent nodes, and therefore do not recognize that node 1 cannot be infected without node 0 being infected. In the above, the state of adjacent nodes is only accounted for via the infection probabilities of those neigboring nodes (in the $\\prod_{k\\in N_i} \\left(1-\\beta  I_k(t)\\right)$ term). But often the infection probability of a node is *conditional on the state* of a neighboring node, not just on its infection probability. So we need to keep track of the joint distribution of the nodes across states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, this means explicitly modeling the joint probabilities of the set of four possible states of the network $\\{(I, I), (S, S), (I, S), (S, I)\\}$. To begin, we know $P(S,I) = 0$ because it's impossible for node 1 to be infected without node 0 being infected. Similarly, we know $P(S,S)=0.6$ because node 0 is susceptible with probability 0.6 and in that case cannot infect node 1. For the outcome $(I,S)$ we know that node 0 must initially be infected and that it must not pass on the infection to node 1 after $t=4$ attempts, therefore $P(I,S)=0.4\\times(1-0.2)^4=0.16$. Finally, the probability that both are infected after 4 periods is $P(I,I) = 0.4\\times(1-0.41) = 0.24$. We can then calculate the required marginal probabilities as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    I_0(4) = P(I,S) + P(I,I) &= 0.4\\\\\n",
    "    I_1(4) = P(S,I) + P(I,I) &= 0.24\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is exactly what the Monte Carlo approach above yields. To perform a similar calculation for a 3-node network requires $2^3=8$ joint probabilities, and a four-node network requires $2^4=16$ etc., which quickly gets out of hand. For example, on a smallish network with 300 nodes, there are $2\\times10^{91}$ conditional probabilities, which is greater than the number of atoms in the universe. Fortunately, there is a more convenient way around this."

    "## Dynamic Message Passing\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) was developed in the context of epidemic spreading by [Karrer and Newman (2010)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5673) for continuous SIR models, which began a fairly active literature. For example, [Lokhov et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5315) used DMP to infer the origin of a given epidemic in a discrete time setting, [Lokhov et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1255) expanded their earlier work to more general unidirectional models with an arbitrary number of states, and [Shrestha et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02192) generalized DMP to recurrent state models like SIS (they also seemed to coin the \"echo chamber\" term). [Wang et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04216) provide a good summary and history of this literature within the broader context of theoretical approaches to epidemic spreading. In this post, we'll follow most closely the notation of [Koher et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05809), although the general principles are the same for all the papers above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to move from a node-centric to an edge-centric focus. By keeping track of the movement of infection across edges, we can disallow an edge to transmit infection two ways and therefore help prevent the echo chamber effect. This is done by defining three new edge-specific \"message\" variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\theta_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)$ is the probability that the disease has not passed from $k$ to $i$ up to time $t$\n",
    "2. $I_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)$ is the probability that $k$ is infected at time $t$ as a result of having received the disease from a node other than $i$, and has not yet passed the infection to $i$\n",
    "3. $S_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)$ is the probability that $k$ has not been infected by any of its neighbors that are not $i$ up to time $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of the above variables take some time to chew over - they were not very intuitive to me when I first came across them. Another way to think about them is to imagine $i$ being in a \"cavity\" state, where it can receive but not pass on infection. In fact, DMP is often referred to as the \"cavity method\" for this reason. In this case, \n",
    "$S_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)$ is the probability that $k$ is susceptible at time $t$ provided $i$ is in the cavity state. Because $k$ is not affected by the state of $i$, it stays susceptible if it doesn't contract the disease from any of its remaining neighbors. Similarly, $I_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)$ is the probability that $k$ is infected given that $i$ is in the cavity state and was therefore infected by a neighbor other than $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that $i$ is susceptible at time $t$ can therefore be expressed as the probability that it was initially susceptible, $z_i = 1-I_i(0)$, multiplied by the probability that no adjacent nodes transmitted the infection up to time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_i(t) = z_i \\prod_{k\\in N_i}\\theta_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we just need to describe the evolution of the three message variables. Beginning at $\\theta_{k\\rightarrow i}(0)=1$, the probability that the disease has not passed from $k$ to $i$ falls each period by the probability that a transmission does occur across that edge, which is equal to $\\beta$ multiplied by the probability that $k$ is infected and has not earlier transmitted the disease to $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_{k\\rightarrow i}(t+1) = \\theta_{k\\rightarrow i}(t) -\\beta I_{k\\rightarrow i} (t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning at $I_{k\\rightarrow i}(0) = I_k(0)$, the probability that $k$ is infected and has not passed the disease to $i$ is equal to that same probability in the previous period multiplied by the probability that it did not transmit, plus the probability that it is newly infected from a non-$i$ node. This latter is equal to the reduction in $S_{k\\rightarrow i}$ because, in the case of $i$ being in the cavity state, it is equal to the reduction in the probability that $k$ has not been infected by any of its non-$i$ neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{k\\rightarrow i} (t+1) = (1-\\beta)I_{k\\rightarrow i} (t) + (S_{k\\rightarrow i}(t)-S_{k\\rightarrow i}(t+1))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the following expression is very similar to the above for $S_{i}$ but the product term excludes the $\\theta_{i\\rightarrow k}$ term because it assumes that $i$ is in the cavity state. Since $k$ is not affected by the state of $i$, it stays susceptible if it doesn't contract the disease from any of its remaining incident neighbors. This can also be viewed as a conditional probability where the joint probability $S_k$ is divided by the marginal probability $\\theta_{i\\rightarrow k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{k\\rightarrow i}(t+1) = z_k \\prod_{j\\in N_k\\setminus i} \\theta_{j\\rightarrow k}(t+1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined effect of the above equations is that when computing the infection rate for a given node, we deliberately neglect the events where its neighbors received the infection from that node and then immediately pass it back. So the rate at which $k$ infects $i$ is proportional to the probability that $k$ was infected by a non-$i$ neighbor, which is why we only include the contribution that comes from neighbors other than $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SI_DMP()` function implements the above. The logic is similar to `SI_naive()` with the added complication of keeping track of the additional $3E$ message variables. The messages are stored in a dataframe `d` with a row per directed edge, which is then updated each period. Compared to `SI_naive()` there is an additional loop over each edge to compute the $S_{k\\rightarrow i}$ values."

    "Sticking with an initial infection probability of 0.4 for node 0, the code below estimates the resulting infection probabilites for the 3-node network of Graph 1 above. This time, and for the rest of this post, we'll extend out the number of periods to $t=20$ to let the echo chamber really take effect. We see that the naive approach suffers again from the echo chamber effect resulting in overestimated infection probabilities. Node 1, after being infected by node 0, \"re-infects\" node 0 and so on, which in turn also raises the infection probability of node 2. The DMP approach, on the other hand, removes this mutual reinforcement between nodes 0 and 1 by only allowing node 1 to reinfect node 0 with disease it has contracted from a \"non-0\" in-neighbor (of which there are none in this case). So DMP achieves the exact solutions. The results also again confirm the far superior run time of the naive analytical approach compared to the Monte Carlo approach, which is hardly sacrificed when moving to the more accurate DMP approach."

    "Most networks are not trees. So the practicality of DMP methods should be assessed against whatever network is of interest. Graph 5 represents a more \"normal\" network based on the Barabasi model with many loops and other common real-world properties like a scale-free degree distribution. In the code below, we give four nodes the chance of being infected initially. Comparing just the first five nodes we see the now familiar pattern of the naive approach overestimating the infection probabilities with the DMP approach closer to the Monte Carlo results. We also show this by computing the average per-node difference in $I_i(t)$ between each analytical method and the MC results. The average error is much lower for DMP, as we'd expect."
